        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) Unsalted Butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Almond Extract</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&#176;F.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.</li>
            <li>On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Scrape some of the dough into your cookie press. Hold the cookie press perpendicular to the lined baking sheet and press out the cookies 2 inches (5 cm) apart. If desired, decorate the shaped cookie dough with sprinkles or press a chocolate chip into the center.</li>
            <li>If the cookie dough becomes too soft as you work, chill the shaped cookie dough in the refrigerator for 10 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Bake until very lightly browned on the edges, 7-9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. If desired, drizzle with melted chocolate.</li>
            <li>Cookies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
