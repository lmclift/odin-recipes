            <li>Preheat oven to 350&#176;F.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the brown sugar and molasses and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.
