        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Long Grain White Rice</li>
            <li>1 clove Garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup Frozen Vegetables</li>
            <li>1 cup Water</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Soy Sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. Toasted Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>1 Green Onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. Sriracha</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the rice, garlic, and frozen vegetables to a small saucepot.</li>
            <li>Combine the water with 1 teaspoon soy sauce, then pour that into the pot. Stir to combine with the rice, vegetables, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Wash one large egg well, then place it in the center of the pot, on top of the rice.</li>
            <li>Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat on to high, and allow the water to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low, and allow the water to continue to simmer for 15 minutes without removing the lid or stirring.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes of simmering, turn the heat off. Remove the egg from the pot and replace the lid right away. Allow the rice to rest with the heat turned off and the lid in place for another five minutes.</li>
            <li>After removing the egg from the pot, place the egg in a bowl of ice water or place it under cold running water for a few minutes to stop the cooking process.</li>
            <li>After letting the rice and veggies rest for five minutes, remove the lid and fluff with a fork. Season the rice and veggies with the sesame oil and another 1 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rice and vegetables to a bowl. Peel the egg and slice it in half or into quarters, then place it on top of the rice. Top the bowl with sliced green onion and a drizzle of sriracha.</li>
